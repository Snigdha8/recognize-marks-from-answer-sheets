# recognize-marks-from-answer-sheets
This project is a part of a mini project which aimed to develop a program/software using image processing and computer vision techniques to extract accurate data from tables present in the images of front page of the answer sheets.
<br>
The 'mini project' folder contains the detailed project goal/expectation and 5 sample images. However the code has been tested on few more images which were a bit skewed, rotated and had different lighting conditions.
<br>
To understand how we tried to recognize digits from the answer sheets, refer to the documentation called 'IVP Mini Project Documentation_.pdf'. 
<br>
In this project, we tried to use pure image processing to preprocess the images and extract digits from them.
